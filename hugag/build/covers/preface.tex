\pmb{Pitch} : At times throughout the score, justly tuned intervals are indicated by the use of Helmholtz-Ellis notation combined with cent deviations from equal temperament for use with an electronic tuner. When no example pitch is given with the cent deviation, the mark is a deviation of the nearest ``standard'' accidental. If the performers wish to interpret the score without cent-tuning, the approximation of pitches to the nearest semi-tone is acceptable. When Helmholtz-Ellis notation is not given, the pitches are to be played as usual.

\pmb{Bow Rotation Indications} : \circled{1} $ordinario$ (abbreviated as $ord.$) and \circled{2} $col \ legno \ tratto$ (abbreviated as $clt.$). When these abbreviations are not present, the performer should default to $ordinario$ bowing techniques. \circled{3} In measure 236, the second violin is given the direction to place the bow on the two lowest strings and to twist the bow in a clockwise motion, first pointing the tip of the bow toward the shoulder then toward the scroll, to create a crackling sound. This is written in degrees of a circle, where the length of the bow is the radius, with an arrowed arc pointing in which direction the bow should be twisted.

\leftskip0.25in
\pmb{String Contact Points} : The indications of string contact positions such as $sul \ tasto$ (abbreviated as $st.$), $sul \ ponticello$ (abbreviated as $sp.$) etc. should be considered as points along the continuum of the length string. When preceded by an $m$ the marks should be $molto \ sul \ ponticello$ and $molto \ sul \ tasto.$ The performer should make an effort to smoothly transition from one position to the next when abbreviations are connected by an arrow. When this arrow is not present, the performer should change position $subito$.

\pmb{Dynamic Indications} : Dynamics marks should be considered ``effort dynamics.'' As such, $forte$ represents a heavy bow pressure rather than a ``loud'' resultant sound. Likewise, $piano$ represents a light bow pressure as opposed to a ``quiet'' resultant sound. These indications will often result in unusual bowing timbres when combined with the String Contact Points, and finger pressure alterations. These are the desired effects. The indication ``noise'' is used to indicate a slightly over-pressured bowing at a normal or fast bow speed resulting in complex, upper harmonic noise. This should rarely affect the sounding dynamic.

\leftskip0.25in
\pmb{Miscellaneous} : \circled{1} Tremoli should be performed as fast as possible and not as a measured subdivision of the duration to which they are attached, with $XFB$ representing an $extremely \ flautando \ bow$. When the $noise$ indication is combined with tremolo, the motion should be extremely tight. $XFB$ tremoli should be slightly irregular, comprised of almost full bow strokes. \circled{2} $XSB$ stands for $extremely \ slow \ bow$ which refers to a bow speed so slow that intermittent clicks occur. In parenthesis, an approximate number of clicks per second is given. Clicks should be somewhat irregular and should not be syncronous between players. \circled{3} Diamond note heads represent a left hand finger pressure of a natural harmonic. Harmonic finger pressure is sometimes required on non-natural harmonic nodes, which often results in a multiphonic. \circled{4} Accidentals apply only to the pitch which they immediately precede, but persist through ties.
